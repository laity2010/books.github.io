["2 Intrinsic Valuation Every asset that generates cash flows has an intrinsic value that reflects both its cash flow potential and its risk. Many analysts claim that when significant uncertainty about the future exists, estimating intrinsic value becomes not just difficult but pointless. But we disagree. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, we believe that it is important to look past market perceptions and gauge, as best we can, the intrinsic value of a business or asset. This chapter considers how discounted cash flow valuation models can be utilized to estimate intrinsic value and describes estimation details and possible limitations in the models. Discounted Cash Flow Valuation In discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, an asset’s value is the present value of the expected cash flows on the asset, discounted back at a rate that reflects the riskiness of these cash flows. This section looks at the foundations of the approach and some of the preliminary details of how we estimate its inputs. The Essence of DCF Valuation We buy most assets because we expect them to generate cash flows for us in the future. In discounted cash flow valuation, we begin with a simple proposition. The value of an asset is not what someone perceives it to be worth; it is a function of the expected cash flows on that asset. Put simply, assets with high and predictable cash flows should have higher values than assets with low and volatile cash flows. The notion that the value of an asset is the present value of the cash flows that you expect to generate by holding it is neither new nor revolutionary. The earliest interest rate tables date back to 1340, and the intellectual basis for discounted cash flow valuation was laid by Alfred Marshall and Bohm-Bawerk in the early part of the twentieth century. 1 The principles of modern valuation were developed by Irving Fisher in two books—The Rate of Interest in 1907 and The Theory of Interest in 1930. 2 In these books, he presented the notion of the internal rate of return. In the last 50 years, we have seen discounted cash flow models extend their reach into security ","and business valuation, and the growth has been aided and abetted by developments in portfolio theory. Intrinsic valuation is, in some sense, an act of faith. We believe that every asset has an intrinsic value, and we try to estimate that intrinsic value by looking at an asset’s fundamentals. What is intrinsic value? Consider it the value that would be attached to an asset by an all-knowing analyst with access to all information available right now and a perfect valuation model. No such analyst exists, of course, but we all aspire to be as close as we can to this perfect analyst. The problem lies in the fact that none of us ever gets to see the true intrinsic value of an asset. Therefore, we have no way of knowing whether our discounted cash flow valuations are close to the mark. Equity Versus Firm Valuation Of the approaches for adjusting for risk in discounted cash flow valuation, the most common one is the risk-adjusted discount rate approach. Here we use higher discount rates to discount expected cash flows when valuing riskier assets and lower discount rates when valuing safer assets. We can approach discounted cash flow valuation in two ways, and they can be framed in terms of the financial balance sheet introduced in Chapter 1, “The Dark Side of Valuation .” The first is to value the entire business, with both existing assets (assets-in-place) and growth assets; this is often called firm or enterprise valuation. Figure 2.1 shows an example. Figure 2.1 Valuing a Firm (Business) The cash flows before debt payments and after reinvestment needs are called free cash flows to the firm, and the discount rate that reflects the composite cost of financing from all sources of capital is the cost of capital . ","The second way is to value just the equity stake in the business; this is called equity valuation. Figure 2.2 shows an example. Figure 2.2 Valuing Equity The cash flows after debt payments and reinvestment needs are called free cash flows to equity, and the discount rate that reflects just the cost of equity financing is the cost of equity. With publicly traded firms, it can be argued that the only cash flow equity investors get from the firm is dividends, and that discounting expected dividends back at the cost of equity should yield the value of equity in the firm. Note also that we can always get from the former (firm value) to the latter (equity value) by netting out the value of all nonequity claims from firm value. Done right, the value of equity should be the same whether it is valued directly (by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity) or indirectly (by valuing the firm and subtracting the value of all nonequity claims). Inputs to a DCF Valuation While we can choose to value just the equity or the entire business, we need four basic inputs for a value estimate. How we define the inputs will differ depending on whether we do firm or equity valuation. Figure 2.3 summarizes the determinants of value. ","Figure 2.3 Determinants of Value The first input is the cash flow from existing assets. This is defined as either predebt (and to the firm) or post-debt (and to equity) earnings, net of reinvestment to generate future growth. With equity cash flows, we can use an even stricter definition of cash flow and consider only dividends paid. The second input is growth. Growth in operating income is the key input when valuing the entire business. Growth in equity income (net income or earnings per share) is the focus when valuing equity. The third input is the discount rate. This is defined as the cost of the firm’s overall capital when valuing the business and as cost of equity when valuing equity. The final input, allowing for closure, is the terminal value, defined as the firm’s (equity’s) estimated value at the end of the forecast period in firm (equity) valuation. The rest of this section focuses on estimating the inputs into discounted cash flow models. We start with cash flows and then move on to risk (and discount rates). We close with a discussion of how best to estimate the growth rate for the high-growth period and the value at the end of that period. Cash Flows Leading up to this section, we noted that cash flows can be estimated either to just equity investors (cash flows to equity) or to all suppliers of capital (cash flows to the firm). This section begins with the strictest measure of cash flow to equity—the dividends received by investors. It then moves to more expansive measures of cash flows, which generally require more information. ","Dividends When an investor buys stock in a publicly traded company, he generally expects to get two types of cash flows—dividends during the holding period, and an expected price at the end of the holding period. Because this expected price is itself determined by future dividends, the value of a stock is the present value of just expected dividends. If we accept this premise, the only cash flow to equity that we should be considering in valuation is the dividend paid. Because many firms do not pay dividends, this number can be zero, at least for the near term, but it should never be negative. Augmented Dividends One of the limitations of focusing on dividends is that many companies, especially in the U.S. but increasingly around the world, have shifted from dividends to stock buybacks as their mechanism for returning cash to stockholders. While only stockholders who sell back their stock receive cash from a buyback, it still represents cash returned to equity investors. In 2016, for instance, firms in the U.S. returned twice as much cash in the form of stock buybacks as they did in dividends. Focusing only on dividends will result in the undervaluation of equity. One simple way of adjusting for this is to augment the dividend with stock buybacks and look at the cumulative cash returned to stockholders: Augmented Dividends = Dividends + Stock Buybacks One problem, though, is that unlike dividends that are smoothed out over time, stock buybacks can spike in some years and be followed by years of inaction. Therefore, we must normalize buybacks by using average buybacks over a period of time (say, five years) to arrive at more reasonable annualized numbers. Potential Dividends (Free Cash Flow to Equity) With both dividends and augmented dividends, we trust managers at publicly traded firms to return to pay out to stockholders any excess cash left over after meeting operating and reinvestment needs. However, we do know that managers do not always follow this practice, as evidenced by the large cash balances that you see at most publicly traded firms. To estimate what managers could have returned to equity investors, we develop a measure of potential dividends that we call the free cash flow to equity. Intuitively, this measures the cash left over after taxes and reinvestment needs, and that debt cash flows have been met. It is measured as follows: ","Consider the equation in pieces. We begin with net income, because that is the earnings generated for equity investors; it is after interest expenses and taxes. We compute what the firm has to reinvest in two parts: Reinvestment in long-lived assets is measured as the difference between capital expenditures (the amount invested in long-lived assets during the period) and depreciation (the accounting expense generated by capital expenditures in prior periods). We net the latter because it is not a cash expense and hence can be added back to net income. Reinvestment in short-lived assets is measured by the change in noncash working capital. In effect, increases in inventory and accounts receivable represent cash tied up in assets that do not generate returns—wasting assets. The reason we don’t consider cash in the computation is because we assume that companies with large cash balances generally invest them in low-risk, marketable securities like commercial paper and Treasury bills. These investments earn a low but fair rate of return and therefore are not wasting assets. 3 To the extent that non-cash current assets are offset by the use of supplier credit and accounts payable, the effect on cash flows can be muted. The overall change in noncash working capital therefore is investment in short-term assets. Reinvestment reduces cash flow to equity investors, but it provides a payoff in terms of future growth. We will reconsider whether the net effect is positive or negative after we consider how best to estimate growth. The final inputs into the process are the negative cash flows associated with the repayment of old debt and the positive cash flows to equity investors from raising new debt. If old debt is replaced with new debt of exactly the same magnitude, this term will be zero, but it will generate positive (or negative) cash flows when debt issues exceed (or are less than) debt repayments. Focusing on just debt cash flows allows us to zero in on a way to simplify this computation. In the special case where the capital expenditures and working capital are expected to be financed at a fixed debt ratio δ, and principal repayments are made from new debt issues, the FCFE is measured as follows: FCFE = Net Income + (1− δ) (Capital Expenditures − Depreciation) + (1 − δ) Δ Working Capital In effect, we are assuming that a firm with a 30% debt ratio that is growing through reinvestment will choose to fund 30% of its reinvestment needs with new debt and replace old debt that comes due with new debt. There is one more way in which we can present the free cash flow to equity. If we define the portion of the net income that equity investors reinvest into the firm as the equity reinvestment rate, we can state the FCFE as a function of this rate: ","A final note is needed on the contrast between the first two measures of cash flows to equity (dividends and augmented dividends) and this measure. Unlike those measures, which can never be less than zero, the free cash flow to equity can be negative for a number of reasons. The first is that the net income could be negative, a not-uncommon phenomenon even for mature firms. The second reason is that reinvestment needs can overwhelm net income, which is often the case for growth companies, especially early in the life cycle. The third reason is that large debt repayments coming due that have to be funded with equity cash flows can cause negative FCFE. Highly levered firms that are trying to bring down their debt ratios can go through years of negative FCFE. The fourth reason is that the quirks of the reinvestment process, where firms invest large amounts in long-lived and short-lived assets in some years and nothing in others, can cause the FCFE to be negative in the big reinvestment years and positive in others. As with buybacks, we have to consider normalizing reinvestment numbers across time when estimating cash flows to equity. If the FCFE is negative, the firm needs to raise fresh equity. Cash Flow to the Firm The cash flow to the firm should be both after taxes and after all reinvestment needs have been met. Because a firm raises capital from debt and equity investors, the cash flow to the firm should be before debt cash flows—interest expenses, debt repayments, and new debt issues. The cash flow to the firm can be measured in two ways. One is to add up the cash flows to all the different claim holders in the firm. Thus, the cash flows to equity investors (estimated using one of the three measures described in this section) are added to the cash flows to debt holders (interest and net debt payments) to arrive at the cash flow. The other approach is to start with operating earnings and to estimate the cash flows to the firm prior to debt payments but after reinvestment needs have been met: It is easiest to understand FCFF by contrasting it with FCFE. First, we begin with after- tax operating income instead of net income. The former is before interest expenses, whereas the latter is after interest expenses. Second, we adjust the operating income for taxes, computed as if we were taxed on the entire income, whereas net income is already an after-tax number. 4 Third, while we subtract reinvestment, just as we did to ","arrive at free cash flows to equity, we do not net out the effect of debt cash flows, because we are now looking at cash flows to all capital, not just to equity. Another way of presenting the same equation is to cumulate the net capital expenditures and working capital change into one number and state it as a percentage of the after-tax operating income. This ratio of reinvestment to after-tax operating income is called the reinvestment rate, and the free cash flow to the firm can be written as follows: Note that the reinvestment rate can exceed 100%, if the firm has substantial reinvestment needs. 5 The reinvestment rate can also be less than zero for firms that are divesting assets and shrinking capital. A few final thoughts about free cash flow to the firm are worth noting before we move on to discount rates. First, the free cash flow to the firm can be negative, just as the FCFE can, but debt cash flows can no longer be the culprit. Even highly levered firms that are paying down debt will report positive FCFF while also registering negative FCFE. If the FCFF is negative, the firm will raise fresh capital, with the mix of debt and equity being determined by the mix used to compute the cost of capital. Second, the cash flow to the firm is the basis for all cash distributions made by the firm to its investors. Dividends, stock buybacks, interest payments, and debt repayments all have to be made out of these cash flows. ","Estimating Cash Flows for a Firm: 3M in 2007 Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) is a large market capitalization company with operations in transportation, health care, office supplies, and electronics. In 2007, the firm reported operating income, before taxes, of $5,344 million and net income of $4,096 million. Interest expenses for the year amounted to $210 million, and interest income on cash and marketable securities was $132 million. The firm also paid dividends of $1,380 million during the year and bought back $3,239 million of stock. The effective tax rate during the year was 32.1%, but the marginal tax rate is 35%. During 2007, 3M reported $1,422 million in capital expenditures and cash acquisitions of $539 million. The depreciation and amortization charges for the year amounted to $1,072 million. The noncash working capital increased by $243 million during 2007. Finally, 3M repaid $2,802 million of debt during the year but raised $4,024 million in new debt. That creates a net debt cash flow (positive) of $1,222 million. With this data, we can first estimate the free cash flows to equity as shown in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4 Free Cash Flows to Equity Note that the net debt issued reflects the new debt issues, netted out against debt repaid. The free cash flow to the firm for 2007 can also be computed, as shown in Figure 2.5. ","Figure 2.5 Free Cash Flow to 3M Figure 2.6 summarizes all four estimates of cash flows for 3M for 2007— dividends, augmented dividends, free cash flows to equity, and free cash flows to the firm. Figure 2.6 Comparison of Cash Flow Estimates: 3M in 2007 How can we reconcile these very different numbers? During 2007, 3M increased its borrowing and used the funds from the additional debt and cash accumulated in prior years to buy back stock. Risk Cash flows that are riskier should be assessed a lower value than more stable cash flows, but how do we measure risk and reflect it in value? In conventional discounted cash flow valuation models, the discount rate becomes the vehicle for conveying our concerns about risk. We use higher discount rates on riskier cash flows and lower discount rates on safer cash flows. This section begins by contrasting how the risk in equity can vary from the risk in a business. Then it considers the mechanics of estimating the cost of equity and capital. ","Business Risk Versus Equity Risk Before we delve into the details of risk measurement and discount rates, we should draw a contrast between two different ways of thinking about risk that relate to the financial balance sheet presented in Chapter 1. In the first, we think about the risk in a firm’s operations or assets—the risk in the business. In the second, we look at the risk in the equity investment in this business. Figure 2.7 captures the differences between the two measures. Figure 2.7 Risk in Business Versus Risk in Equity As with any other aspect of the balance sheet, this one has to balance as well, with the weighted risk in the assets being equal to the weighted risk in the ingredients to capital —debt and equity. Note that the risk in the equity investment in a business is determined partly by the risk of the business the firm is in and partly by its choice of how much debt to use to fund that business. The equity in a safe business can be rendered risky if the firm uses substantial debt to fund that business. In discount rate terms, the risk in the equity in a business is measured with the cost of equity, whereas the risk in the business is captured in the cost of capital. The latter is a weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt, with the weights reflecting the proportional use of each source of funding. Measuring Equity Risk and the Cost of Equity Measuring the risk in equity investments and converting that risk measure into a cost of equity is rendered difficult by two factors. The first is that equity has an implicit cost, which is unobservable, unlike debt, which comes with an explicit cost in the form of an interest rate. The second factor is that risk is in the eyes of the beholder and different equity investors in the same business can be very different. As a consequence, they might demand different expected returns. ","THE DIVERSIFIED MARGINAL I NVESTOR If a company had only one equity investor, estimating equity risk and the cost of equity would be far simpler. We would measure the risk to the investor of investing in equity in that company. Then we would assess a reasonable rate of return, given that risk. In a publicly traded company, we run into the practical problem that the equity investors number in the hundreds, if not the thousands. They vary not only in size, from small to large investors, but also in risk aversion. So, whose perspective should we take when measuring risk and cost of equity? In corporate finance and valuation, we develop the notion of the marginal investor—the investor most likely to influence the market price of publicly traded equity. The marginal investor in a publicly traded stock has to own enough stock in the company to make a difference, when he or she trades, and must be willing to trade on that stock. The common theme shared by risk-and-return models in finance is that the marginal investor is diversified, and we measure the risk in an investment as the risk added to a diversified portfolio. Put another way, only that portion of the risk in an investment that can be attributed to the broader market or economy, and hence is not diversifiable, should be built into expected returns. MODELS FOR EXPECTED RETURN (COST OF EQUITY) It is on the issue of how best to measure this nondiversifiable risk that the different risk-and-return models in finance part ways. Let us consider the alternatives: In the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), this risk is captured in the beta that we assign an asset/business. That number has the burden of measuring exposure to all the components of market risk. The expected return on an investment can then be specified as a function of three variables: the risk-free rate, the beta of the investment, and the equity risk premium (the premium demanded for investing in the average risk investment): Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta investment × (Equity Risk Premium) The risk-free rate and equity risk premium are the same for all investments in a market, but the beta captures the investment’s market risk exposure. A beta of 1 represents an average risk investment. Betas above (or below) 1 indicate investments that are riskier (or safer) than the average risk investment in the market. The arbitrage pricing and multifactor models allow for multiple sources of nondiversifiable (or market) risk and estimate betas against each one. The expected return on an investment can be written as a function of the multiple betas (relative to each market risk factor) and the risk premium for that factor. If the model has k factors, with β j and risk premium j representing the beta and risk premium of factor j, the expected return on the investment can be written as follows: ","Note that the capital asset pricing model can be written as a special case of these multifactor models, with a single factor (the market) replacing the multiple factors. The final class of models can be categorized as proxy models. With these models, we essentially give up on measuring risk directly. Instead, we look at historical data for clues on what types of investments (stocks) have earned high returns in the past. Then we use the common characteristic(s) they share as a measure of risk. For instance, researchers have found that market capitalization and price-to-book ratios are correlated with returns. Stocks with small market capitalization and low price-to-book ratios have historically earned higher returns than large market cap stocks with higher price-to-book ratios. Using the historical data, we can then estimate the expected return for a company based on its market capitalization and price-to-book ratio: Expected Return = a + b(Market Capitalization) + c(Price-to-Book Ratio) Because we are no longer working within the confines of an economic model, it is not surprising that researchers keep finding new variables (trading volume, price momentum) that improve the predictive power of these models. The open question, though, is whether these variables are truly proxies for risk or indicators of market inefficiency. In effect, we might be explaining away the market’s misvaluation of classes of stock by using proxy models for risk. ESTIMATION I SSUES With the CAPM and multifactor models, the inputs that we need for the expected return are straightforward. We need to come up with a risk-free rate and an equity risk premium (or premiums in the multifactor models) to use across all investments. After we have these market-wide estimates, we measure the risk (beta or betas) in individual investments. This section lays out the broad principles that govern these estimates. Future chapters will return to the details of how best to make these estimates for different types of businesses. The risk-free rate is the expected return on an investment with guaranteed returns; in effect, your expected return is also your actual return. Because the return is guaranteed, an investment must meet two conditions to be risk-free. The first is that the entity making the guarantee can have no default risk; this is why we use government securities to derive risk-free rates, a necessary though not always sufficient condition. As you will see in Chapter 6, many governments have default risk and the bonds they issue are therefore not risk free. The second condition is that there can be no reinvestment risk and that the time horizon ","matters. A six-month Treasury bill is not risk-free if you are looking at a five- year time horizon, because you are exposed to reinvestment risk. In fact, even a five-year Treasury bond may not be riskless, because the coupons received every six months have to be reinvested. Clearly, getting a risk-free rate is not as simple as it looks at the outset. The equity risk premium is the premium that investors demand for investing in risky assets (or equities) as a class, relative to the risk-free rate. It is a function not only of how much risk investors perceive in equities as a class, but also the risk aversion that they bring to the market. It also follows that the equity risk premium can change over time, as market risk and risk aversion both change. The conventional practice for estimating equity risk premiums is to use the historical risk premium—the premium investors have earned over long periods (say, 75 years) investing in equities instead of risk-free (or close to risk-free) investments. Chapter 7, “Risky Ventures: Assessing the Price of Risk ,” questions the efficacy of this approach and offers alternatives. To estimate the beta in the CAPM and betas in multifactor models, we draw on statistical techniques and historical data. The standard approach for estimating the CAPM beta is to run a regression of returns on a stock against returns on a broad equity market index. The slope captures how much the stock moves for any given market move. To estimate betas in the arbitrage pricing model, we use historical return data on stocks and factor analysis to extract both the number of factors in the models and factor betas for individual companies. As a consequence, the beta estimates that we obtain always look backward (because they are derived from past data) and are noisy (they are statistical estimates, with standard errors). In addition, these approaches clearly will not work for investments that do not have a trading history (young companies, divisions of publicly traded companies). One solution is to replace the regression beta with a bottom-up beta—one that is based on industry averages for the businesses that the firm is in, adjusted for differences in financial leverage. 6 Because industry averages are more precise than individual regression betas, and the weights on the businesses can reflect a firm’s current mix, bottom-up betas generally offer better estimates for the future. ","Estimating the Cost of Equity for 3M Because 3M is a publicly traded stock with a long history, we can use its price history to run a regression against the market index to derive a regression beta. Figure 2.8 provides a regression beta for 3M against the S&P 500 using two years of weekly returns against the S&P 500. The regression (raw) beta is 0.79; the adjusted beta, which is the raw beta moved toward the market average beta of 1, is 0.86. Although we do have a regression beta, all the normal caveats we listed in the preceding section apply. It is backward-looking (for the last two years) and has a standard error (albeit a small one of 0.07). The regression results would have been very different if we had run the regression using a different time period (say, five years) and different return intervals (daily or monthly) and if we had used a different market index. Figure 2.8 Regression Beta for 3M To yield a contrasting value, we estimated a beta for 3M by breaking it into individual businesses and taking a weighted average of the business betas (see Table 2.1). ","Table 2.1 Bottom-Up Beta Estimate for 3M Business RevenuesEV/SalesEstimated Value Weight in Firm Unlevered Beta Industrial and transportation $7,724 1.07 $8,265 27.42% 0.82 Health care $3,968 1.83 $7,261 24.09% 1.40 Display and graphics $3,892 1.63 $6,344 21.04% 1.97 Consumer and office $3,403 0.78 $2,654 8.80% 0.99 Safety, security, and protection $3,070 1.09 $3,346 11.10% 1.16 Electronics and communications $2,775 0.82 $2,276 7.55% 1.32 3M as a firm $30,146 100.00% 1.29 The unlevered betas of the businesses are obtained by averaging the regression betas of publicly traded firms in each business and adjusting the average regression beta for the average financial leverage (D/E ratio) in each business. The EV/sales ratio measures the typical multiple of revenues that firms in each business trade for. Applying 3M’s debt-to-equity ratio of 8.80% in 2007 (based on market values for debt and equity) to the unlevered beta of 1.29 yields an equity beta of 1.36 for 3M: Levered (Equity) Beta = 1.29 (1 + (1 - .35) (8.80%)) = 1.36 Using the ten-year Treasury bond rate of 3.72% in September 2007 as the risk-free rate and a 4% equity risk premium yields a cost of equity of 9.16%: Obviously, using a higher equity risk premium would have led to a higher cost of equity. ","The Cost of Debt Although equity investors receive residual cash flows and bear the bulk of the operating risk in most firms, lenders to the firm also face the risk that they will not receive their promised payments—interest expenses and principal repayments. To cover this default risk, lenders add a “default spread” to the riskless rate when they lend money to firms; the greater the perceived risk of default, the greater the default spread and the cost of debt. The other dimension on which debt and equity can vary is in their treatment for tax purposes, with cash flows to equity investors (dividends and stock buybacks) usually coming from after-tax cash flows, whereas interest payments are generally tax-deductible. In effect, the tax law in much of the world provides a benefit to debt and lowers the cost of borrowing to businesses. To estimate the cost of debt for a firm, we need three components. The first is the risk- free rate, an input to the cost of equity as well. As a general rule, the risk-free rate used to estimate the cost of equity should be used to compute the cost of debt as well. If the cost of equity is based on a long-term risk-free rate, as it often is, the cost of debt should be based on the same rate. The second component is the default spread. Three approaches can be used, depending on the firm being analyzed: If the firm has traded bonds outstanding, the current market interest rate on the bond (yield to maturity) is used as the cost of debt. This is appropriate only if the bond is liquid and is representative of the firm’s overall debt; even risky firms can issue safe bonds, backed up by the firms’ most secure assets. If the firm has a bond rating from an established ratings agency such as S&P or Moody’s, we can estimate a default spread based on the rating. In September 2008, for instance, the default spread for BBB-rated bonds was 2% and would have been used as the spread for any BBB-rated company. If the firm is unrated and has debt outstanding (bank loans), we can estimate a “synthetic” rating for the firm based on its financial ratios. A simple, albeit effective, approach for estimating the synthetic rating is to base it entirely on a firm’s interest coverage ratio (EBIT/interest expense); higher interest coverage ratios yield higher ratings than lower interest coverage ratios. The final input needed to estimate the cost of debt is the tax rate. Because interest expenses save you taxes at the margin, the tax rate that is relevant for this calculation is not the effective tax rate but the marginal tax rate. In the U.S., where the federal corporate tax rate was 35% and state and local taxes added to this, the marginal tax rate for corporations in 2008 was between 25% and 40%, much higher than the average effective tax rate, across companies, of 28%. The after-tax cost of debt for a firm therefore is as follows: After-Tax Cost of Debt = (Risk-Free Rate + Default Spread) (1 - Marginal Tax Rate) ","The after-tax cost of debt for most firms will be significantly lower than the cost of equity for two reasons. First, debt in a firm generally is less risky than its equity, because lenders have first and a contractual claim on the cash flows, leading to lower expected returns. Second, a tax saving is associated with debt that does not exist with equity. ","Estimating the Cost of Debt for 3M To estimate the synthetic rating for 3M, we begin with an estimate of the interest coverage ratio in 2007: Given its large market capitalization (more than $50 billion), we use Table 2.2 to extract the synthetic rating and the default spread on 3M debt. Table 2.2 Interest Coverage Ratios, Ratings, and Default Spreads Interest Coverage Ratio Rating Typical Default Spread > 12.5 AAA 0.75% 9.50 to 12.50 AA 1.25% 7.50 to 9.50 A+ 1.40% 6.00 to 7.50 A 1.50% 4.50 to 6.00 A− 1.70% 4.00 to 4.50 BBB 2.50% 3.50 to 4.00 BB+ 3.20% 3.00 to 3.50 BB 3.65% 2.50 to 3.00 B+ 4.50% 2.00 to 2.50 B 5.65% 1.50 to 2.00 B− 6.50% 1.25 to 1.50 CCC 7.50% 0.80 to 1.25 CC 10.00% 0.50 to 0.80 C 12.00% < 0.50 D 20.00% The rating that we assign to 3M is AAA, with a default spread of 0.75%. Adding this spread to the ten-year Treasury bond rate of 3.72% results in a pre-tax cost of ","debt of 4.49%. Just as a contrast, we compute the book interest rate by dividing the interest expenses in 2007 by the book value of debt: Given how sensitive the book interest rate is to different definitions of book value of debt, we remain skeptical about its usefulness. Using a marginal tax rate of 35% on the pre-tax cost of debt of 4.49%, we derive an after-tax cost of debt of 2.91% for the company: Debt Ratios and the Cost of Capital After we have estimated the costs of debt and equity, we still have to assign weights to the two ingredients. To come up with this value, we could start with the mix of debt and equity that the firm uses right now. In making this estimate, the values that we should use are market values, rather than book values. For publicly traded firms, estimating the market value of equity is usually a trivial exercise, where we multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Estimating the market value of debt usually is a more difficult exercise, because most firms have some debt that is not traded. Though many practitioners fall back on book value of debt as a proxy of market value, estimating the market value of debt is still a better practice. When we have the current market value weights for debt and equity for use in the cost of capital, we have a follow-up judgment to make in terms of whether these weights will change or remain stable. If we assume that they will change, we have to specify both what the right or target mix for the firm will be and how soon the change will occur. In an acquisition, for instance, we can assume that the acquirer can replace the existing mix with the target mix instantaneously. As passive investors in publicly traded firms, we have to be more cautious, because we do not control how a firm funds its operations. In this case, we may adjust the debt ratio from the current mix to the target over time, with concurrent changes in the costs of debt, equity, and capital. In fact, the last point about debt ratios and costs of capital changing over time is worth reemphasizing. As companies change over time, we should expect the cost of capital to change as well. ","Estimating the Cost of Capital for 3M In the second sidebar, we estimated a cost of equity of 9.16% for 3M, based on a bottom-up beta estimate of 1.36. In the third sidebar, we concluded that the after-tax cost of debt for 3M is 2.91%, based on the synthetic AAA rating we assigned the firm. We estimated the market values of equity and debt for the firm in September 2008 (with the resulting weights and overall costs of capital) and derived the cost of capital for the firm. Table 2.3 shows the results. Table 2.3 3M’s Cost of Capital Market Value Proportion of Capital Cost Equity $57,041 91.50% 9.16% Debt $5,297 8.50% 2.91% Capital $62,338 100.00% 8.63% At its current debt ratio of 8.50%, the cost of capital for 3M is 8.63%. Growth Rates No other ingredient in discounted cash flow valuation evokes as much angst as estimating future growth. Unlike cash flows and discount rates, where we often have the security of historical data, growth rates require us to grapple with the future. This section looks at why growth rates can be different for equity and operating earnings. It examines two of the standard approaches for estimating growth (looking at the past, and using analyst estimates). This section closes with a discussion of the fundamentals that determine growth. Equity Versus Operating Earnings As with cash flows and discount rates, a contrast has to be drawn between growth in equity earnings and growth in operating earnings. To make the distinction, consider the simplified version of an income statement shown in Table 2.4. Table 2.4 An Income Statement: Revenues to Earnings per Share Item Factors That Explain Differences in Growth ","Revenues − Operating expenses Changes in operating efficiency/performance Operating leverage EBITDA − Depreciation and amortization Changes in depreciation schedules/rules Amortization of intangibles EBIT − Interest expenses Changes in financial leverage (debt) + Income from cash holdings Changes in cash holdings/interest rates − Taxes Changes in tax rates/rules Net Income / Number of shares Stock buybacks and issues Exercise of past option grants Earnings per Share We are assuming that the firm has no minority holdings in other companies, which would result in an additional line item, just above the net income line, for income from these holdings or majority holdings, which would also create a line item netting out income due to minority investors in these holdings. The growth rates in different measures of earnings (operating income, net income, and earnings per share) generally will be different for most firms. This is especially true of growth firms and firms in transition. Share issues and buybacks: If the number of shares remains fixed, the growth rate in earnings per share should be the same as the growth rate in net income. Firms that generate excess cash flows and use these cash flows to buy back stock register higher growth rates in earnings per share than in net income. Conversely, firms that make a practice of raising new equity (issuing new shares) to fund investments or acquisitions can have higher growth rates in net income than in earnings per share. Financial leverage : The growth rates in operating and net income can diverge if the net interest expense (interest expense minus interest income) grows at a rate different from operating income. Firms that use increasing amounts of debt to ","fund their operations generally report higher growth rates in operating income than net income. However, if that debt is used to buy back shares, the earnings per share growth reflect the fewer shares outstanding. Operating leverage : The growth in operating income can also be very different from the growth in revenues, primarily because some operating expenses are fixed and others are variable. The higher the proportion of the costs that are fixed (higher operating leverage), the greater the growth rate in operating income relative to the growth in revenues. In effect, when asked to estimate growth rates, the first question an analyst has to ask is, “In what item?” If our task is to estimate growth in operating income, we cannot use growth rates in earnings per share as substitutes. Historical and Forecasted Growth Rates When confronted with the task of estimating growth, it is not surprising that analysts turn to the past. In effect, they use growth in revenues or earnings in the recent past as a predictor of growth in the future. Before we put this practice under the microscope, we should add that the historical growth rates for the same company can yield different estimates for the following reasons: Earnings measure : As we noted, the growth rates in earnings per share, net income, operating income, and revenues can be very different for the same firm over a specified time period. Period of analysis: For firms that have been in existence for a long time, the growth rates can be very different if we look at ten years of history as opposed to five years. Averaging approach : Even if we agree on an earnings measure and time period for the analysis, the growth rates we derive can be different, depending on how we compute the values. We could, for instance, compute the growth rate in each period and average the growth rates over time, yielding an arithmetic average. Alternatively, we could use just the starting and ending values for the measure and compute a geometric average. For firms with volatile earnings, the latter can generate a very different (and lower) value for growth than the former. A debate on how best to estimate historical growth makes sense only if it is a good predictor of future growth. Unfortunately, studies that have looked at the relationship have generally concluded that The relationship between past and future growth is a very weak one. Scaling matters, with growth dropping off significantly as companies grow. Firms in cyclical or commodity sectors go through growth cycles, with high growth in one period followed by low growth in the next. ","If historical growth is not a useful predictor of future growth, we can use another source for future growth. We can draw on those who know the firm better than we do— equity research analysts who have tracked the firm for years, or the managers in the firm—and use their estimates of growth. On the plus side, these forecasts should be based on better information than we have available. After all, managers should have a clearer sense of how much they will reinvest in their own businesses and what the potential returns on investments are when they do. And equity research analysts have sector experience and informed sources they can draw on for better information. On the minus side, neither managers nor equity research analysts are objective about the future; managers are likely to overestimate their capacity to generate growth, and analysts have their own biases. In addition, both analysts and managers can get caught up in the mood of the moment, overestimating growth in buoyant times and underestimating growth in down times. As with historical growth, studies indicate that neither analyst estimates nor management forecasts are good predictors of future growth. Fundamental Growth Rates If we cannot draw on history or trust managers and analysts, how, then, do we estimate growth? The answer lies in the fundamentals within a firm that ultimately determine its growth rate. This section considers the two sources of growth—new investments that expand the business, and improved efficiency on existing investments. Decomposing Growth The best way to consider earnings growth is to break it down algebraically into its constituent parts. Define E t to be the earnings in period t, I t to be the capital invested in all past investments at the start of period t, and ROI t as the return on that investment. Thus, we can rewrite E t as E t = ROI t × I t The change in earnings from period t−1 to t, ΔE, can then be written as follows: ΔE = E t − E t−1 = ROI t × I t − ROI t−1 × I t−1 The growth rate is written in terms of ΔE and E t−1 : g = ΔE / E t−1 = (ROI t × I t − ROI t−1 × I t−1 ) / E t−1 Consider the simplest scenario, in which the ROI is stable and does not change from period to period (ROI = ROI t = ROI t−1 ). The expected growth rate in earnings for this firm is ","In other words, the firm’s growth rate is a function of only two variables—the return it makes on new investments (ROI), and the proportion of its earnings that are put into new investments (ΔI/E τ−1 ). The more general scenario is one in which the return on investment does change from period to period. In this case, the expected growth rate can be written as g = ΔE / E t−1 = ROI t × (ΔI/E τ−1 ) + (ROI t − ROI t−1 ) / ROI t−1 This equation is based on the assumption that the return on new investments in period t is identical to the return earned on existing investments in that period. In fact, this can be generalized even further. If we allow the return on new investments, ROI New,t , to be different from the return on existing assets, ROI Existing,t , the expected growth rate can be written as g = ΔE / E t−1 = ROI New,t × (ΔI/E τ−1 ) + (ROI Existing,t − ROI Existing,t−1 ) / ROI Existing,t−1 The first term in this equation captures the growth from new investments, determined by the marginal return on those investments and the proportion invested in these investments. The second term captures the effect of changes in the return on investment on existing assets, a component that we will call efficiency growth. Increasing the return on investment (improving efficiency) will create additional earnings growth, whereas declining efficiency (with drops in the return on investment) will reduce earnings growth. GROWTH FROM NEW I NVESTMENTS Although investment and return on investment are generic terms, how we define them depends on whether we are looking at equity earnings or operating income. When looking at equity earnings, our focus is on the equity portion of investment, and the return is the return on equity. When looking at operating earnings, the focus is on the total investment, and the return is the return on capital. In the cash flow definitions introduced at the start of this chapter, the change in investment is computed as the reinvestment, and the measurement of the reinvestment again varies, depending on the cash flow being discounted. In dividend discount models, reinvestment is defined as retained earnings (any income not paid out as dividends). In free cash flow to equity (firm) models, reinvestment is defined in terms of the equity reinvestment rate (reinvestment rate). Central to any estimate of fundamental growth is the estimate of return on capital or equity. Table 2.5 summarizes the inputs for each measure, depending on the measure of τ ","cash flow that we are focused on. Table 2.5 Measuring Investment and Return on Investment Change in Investment Return on Investment Operating income Return on invested capital (ROC or ROIC) Net income (noncash) Noncash return on equity (NCROE) Earnings per share Return on equity (ROE) Using accounting measures of investment and return on investment is conventional practice. Thus, the book values of equity and invested capital and accounting earnings are used to compute returns on equity and capital: The problem with accounting measures on both dimensions is well documented. Accounting choices on restructuring charges, amortization, and capitalization all make a difference in the final numbers. 7 The final issue that we have to consider is the difference between marginal and average returns. Note that the return on investment that we use to compute the growth from new investments should be the return earned on those investments alone—a marginal return. The return on existing assets is an average return on a portfolio of investments already made. Although we often use the same value for both numbers in valuation, they can be different in practice. ","EFFICIENCY GROWTH For many mature firms with scarce investment opportunities, the potential for growth from new investments is limited. These firms cannot maintain a high reinvestment rate and deliver a high return on capital with that reinvestment. However, they can still grow at healthy rates if they can improve the returns that they earn on existing assets. Conversely, declines in returns on existing assets can translate into drops in earnings growth rates. Stated again in terms of different measures of earnings, efficiency growth can be written as shown in Table 2.6. Table 2.6 Determinants of Efficiency Growth in Earnings Measure of Return on Existing Assets Efficiency Growth Operating income Return on capital Net income (noncash) Noncash return on equity Earnings per share Return on equity When valuing companies, efficiency growth is pure gravy in terms of value created because the growth comes with no concurrent investment cost. Unlike growth from new investments, where the positive effects of growth have to be offset against the negative effect of reinvestment, improving the return on capital on existing assets increases the growth rate without adversely affecting the cash flows. It should as come as no surprise, then, that analysts who want to increase a company’s value draw on the efficiency argument to justify much higher growth rates than those estimated using fundamentals. While the potential for efficiency growth is always there, we should put some commonsense constraints on how much we can draw on this growth: Mature firms have more potential for efficiency growth, with poor returns on capital (equity), than firms that are performing well. This is true for two reasons. First, improving the return on capital is a much more feasible option for a firm that generates a return on capital that is well below the sector average than at a firm that already outperforms the sector. Second, the effect of an improvement in returns on growth is much greater when the return on capital is low than when it is high. A firm that improves its return on capital from 5% to 6% will report a 20% growth rate from efficiency in that period. On the other hand, a firm that improves its return on capital from 25% to 26% will generate a 4% growth rate from efficiency in that period. ","You can draw on increased efficiency to justify growth only for finite periods. After all, a firm cannot be infinitely inefficient. After the inefficiencies, no matter how significant, are fixed, the firm must revert to its sustainable growth rate, based on new investments. In discounted cash flow valuation, this has a practical consequence: you can draw on both efficiency and new investments to justify growth during the high-growth period, but only on new investments to justify growth forever (in the terminal value computation). In closing, growth in a specific firm can come from new investments or improved efficiency, but it has to be earned either way. None of us has the power to endow companies with higher growth rates just because we like the managers or want to make the firm’s value increase. ","Estimating Growth for 3M It makes sense to start with an estimate of historical growth in earnings at 3M. Figure 2.9 presents different estimates of past earnings growth for 3M, given different definitions of earnings and different time periods. Figure 2.9 Historical Growth Rates in Earnings for 3M Note the wildly divergent numbers that we get for past growth. In September 2008, analysts were estimating growth in earnings per share at 3M of between 8% and 9% a year for the next five years. Looking at the fundamentals, it seems unlikely that 3M, given its high existing return on capital and equity, can generate much in terms of efficiency growth. It is, however, reinvesting in new assets. This reinvestment, in conjunction with high returns on capital on new investments, will generate growth. Table 2.7 summarizes growth in dividends, noncash net income, and after-tax operating income using the reinvestment and return characteristics we have estimated for 3M. Table 2.7 Dividends, Net Income, and After-Tax Operating Income: Fundamentals In the Last Financial Year, 2007 Expected for the Next Five Years Expected Expected ","ReinvestmentReturn Expected Growth ReinvestmentReturn Expected Growth Dividends 66.31% 33.93% 22.50% Not forecast Noncash net income −2.27% 47.65% −1.08% 25.00% 30.00% 7.50% After-tax operating income 36.37% 25.31% 9.21% 30.00% 25.00% 7.50% Note that we have stayed fairly close to last year’s estimates of the reinvestment rate and return on capital for 3M. However, we changed the equity reinvestment rate substantially for the next few years to reflect the historical average for this number from 2003 to 2007 and lowered the non-cash return on equity for the same reason. Terminal Value Publicly traded firms do not have to have finite lives. In theory, they can last forever and we cannot estimate cash flows forever. Therefore, we generally impose closure in valuation models by stopping our estimation of cash flows sometime in the future and then computing a terminal value that reflects all cash flows beyond that point. Three approaches generally are used to estimate the terminal value. The most common approach, which is to apply a multiple to earnings in the terminal year to arrive at the terminal value, is inconsistent with intrinsic valuation. Because these multiples are usually obtained by looking at what comparable firms are trading at in the market today, this is a pricing or a relative valuation, rather than a discounted cash flow valuation. Two more legitimate ways of estimating terminal value exist. The first is to estimate a liquidation value for the firm’s assets, assuming that the assets are sold in the terminal year. The other is to estimate a going concern or a terminal value. ","Liquidation Value If we assume that the business will be ended in the terminal year and that its assets will be liquidated at that time, we can estimate the proceeds from the liquidation. This liquidation value still has to be estimated, using a combination of market-based numbers (for assets that have ready markets) and cash flow-based estimates. For firms that have finite lives and marketable assets (like real estate), this represents a fairly simple way of estimating terminal value. For other firms, estimating liquidation value becomes more difficult, either because the assets are not separable (brand name value in a consumer product company) or because there is no market for the individual assets. One approach is to use the estimated book value of the assets as a starting point and to estimate the liquidation value based on the book value. Going Concern or Terminal Value If we treat the firm as a going concern at the end of the estimation period, we can estimate the value of that concern by assuming that cash flows will grow at a constant rate thereafter. If we assume that the firm will last forever, this perpetual growth model draws on a simple present-value equation to arrive at terminal value: 8 Our definitions of cash flow and growth rate have to be consistent with whether we are valuing dividends, cash flows to equity, or cash flows to the firm. The discount rate is the cost of equity for the first two and the cost of capital for the last. The perpetual growth model is a powerful one, but it can be easily misused. In fact, analysts often use it as a piggy bank that they go to whenever they feel that the value they have derived for an asset is too low or high. Small changes in the inputs can alter the terminal value dramatically. Consequently, three key constraints should be imposed on its estimation: Cap the growth rate : Small changes in the stable-growth rate can change the terminal value significantly, and the effect gets larger as the growth rate approaches the discount rate used in the estimation. The fact that a stable-growth rate is constant forever, however, puts strong constraints on how high it can be. Because no firm can grow forever at a rate higher than the growth rate of the economy in which it operates, the constant growth rate cannot be greater than the overall growth rate of the economy. So, what is the maximum stable-growth rate that you can use in a valuation? The answer depends on whether the valuation is being done in real or nominal terms. If it’s the latter, it should reflect the growth rate in the economy in the currency is used to estimate cash flows. With the former, you would use the real-growth rate in the economy as your constraint. With the latter, you would add expected inflation in the currency to the real growth. Setting the stable-growth rate to be less than or equal to the economy’s ","growth rate is not only the consistent thing to do, but it also ensures that the growth rate will be less than the discount rate. This is because of the relationship between the riskless rate that goes into the discount rate and the economy’s growth rate. Note that the riskless rate can be written as Nominal Riskless Rate = Real Riskless Rate + Expected Inflation Rate In the long term, the real riskless rate converges on the economy’s real-growth rate, and the nominal riskless rate approaches the economy’s nominal growth rate. In fact, a simple rule of thumb about the stable-growth rate is that it should not exceed the riskless rate used in the valuation. Use mature company risk characteristics: As firms move from high growth to stable growth, we need to give them the characteristics of stable-growth firms. A firm in stable growth is different from that same firm in high growth on a number of dimensions. In general, you would expect stable-growth firms to be less risky and use more debt. In practice, we should move betas for even high-risk firms toward stable growth and give them debt ratios more consistent with larger, more stable cash flows. Reinvestment and excess-return assumptions: Stable-growth firms tend to reinvest less than high-growth firms. It is critical that we both capture the effects of lower growth on reinvestment and ensure that the firm reinvests enough to sustain its stable-growth rate in the terminal phase. Given the relationship between growth, reinvestment rate, and returns that we established in the section “Decomposing Growth,” we can estimate the reinvestment rate that is consistent with expected growth in Table 2.8. Table 2.8 Reinvestment in Stable Growth Model Reinvestment Rate in Stable Growth Dividend FCFE FCFF Linking the reinvestment rate and retention ratio to the stable-growth rate also makes the valuation less sensitive to assumptions about stable growth. Although increasing the stable-growth rate while holding all else constant can dramatically increase value, changing the reinvestment rate as the growth rate changes creates an offsetting effect: ","The gains from increasing the growth rate are partially or completely offset by the loss in cash flows because of the higher reinvestment rate. Whether value increases or decreases as the stable growth increases depends entirely on what you assume about excess returns. If the return on capital is higher than the cost of capital in the stable- growth period, increasing the stable-growth rate increases value. If the return on capital is equal to the stable-growth rate, increasing the stable-growth rate has no effect on value. Substituting the stable-growth rate as a function of the reinvestment rate from before, you get this: Setting the return on capital equal to the cost of capital, you arrive at the following: You could establish the same propositions with equity income and cash flows and show that the terminal value of equity is a function of the difference between the return on equity and cost of equity: In closing, the key assumption in the terminal value computation is not what growth rate you use in the valuation, but what excess returns accompany that growth rate? If you assume no excess returns, the growth rate becomes irrelevant. Some valuation experts believe that this is the only sustainable assumption, because no firm can maintain competitive advantages forever. In practice, though, there might be some wiggle room, insofar as the firm might become a stable-growth firm before its excess returns go to zero. If that is the case and the firm’s competitive advantages are strong and sustainable (even if they do not last forever), we might be able to give the firm some excess returns in perpetuity. As a simple rule of thumb, these excess returns forever should be modest (< 4 to 5%) and will affect the terminal value. ","High Growth Versus Terminal Value Assumptions at 3M Table 2.9 lists our assumptions about 3M in both the high-growth phase and steady state. Table 2.9 Valuing 3M: High-Growth Versus Stable-Growth Phases High Growth Stable Growth Length of High-Growth Period Next Five Years After Year 5 Growth rate 7.50% 3.00% Debt ratio used in cost-of-capital calculation 8.48% 20.00% Beta used for stock 1.36 1.00 Risk-free rate 3.72% 3.72% Risk premium 4.00% 4.00% Cost of debt 4.47% 4.47% Tax rate 35.00% 35.00% Cost of capital 8.63% 6.76% Return on capital 25.00% 6.76% Reinvestment rate 30.00% 44.40% Note that as the growth declines after year 5, the beta is adjusted toward 1, and the debt ratio is raised to the industry average of 20% to reflect the company’s overall stability. Because the cost of debt is relatively low, we leave it unchanged, resulting in a drop in the cost of capital to 6.76%. We do change the reinvestment rate in stable growth to reflect the assumption that there will be no excess returns in stable growth (return on capital = cost of capital). Using the predicted stable-growth rate of 3% and the return on capital of 6.76% (equal to cost of capital), we derive a reinvestment rate of 44.4%: ","Tying up Loose Ends We have covered the four inputs that go into discounted cash flow valuation models— cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, and the terminal value. The present value we arrive at when we discount the cash flows at the risk-adjusted rates should yield an estimate of value. But getting from that number to what we would be willing to pay per share for equity does require us to consider a few other factors: Cash and marketable securities: Most companies have cash balances that are not insignificant in magnitude. Is this cash balance already incorporated into the present value? The answer depends on how we estimated cash flows. If the cash flows are based on operating income (free cash flow to the firm) or noncash net income, we have not valued cash yet, and it should be added to the present value. On the other hand, if we estimate cash flows from the cumulative net income or use the dividend discount model, cash already has been implicitly valued. The income from cash is part of the final cash flow, and the discount rate presumably has been adjusted to reflect the presence of cash. Cross-holdings in other companies: Companies sometimes invest in other firms, and these cross-holdings can generally be categorized as either minority or majority holdings. With the former, the holdings are usually less than 50%, and the income from the holdings is reported in the income statement below the operating income line. If we use free cash flow to the firm to value the operating assets, we have not valued these minority holdings yet, and they have to be valued explicitly and added to the present value. With majority holdings, which generally exceed 50%, firms usually consolidate the entire subsidiary in their financials and report 100% of the operating income and the subsidiary’s assets. To reflect the portion of the subsidiary that does not belong to them, they report the book value of that portion as minority interest in a balance sheet. If we compute cash flows from consolidated financial statements, we have to subtract the estimated market value of the subsidiary in which you have minority interest. Potential liabilities (not treated as debt): Because we are interested in the value of equity in the firm, we have to consider any potential liabilities we might face that reduce that value. Thus, items like underfunded pension obligations and health care obligations might not meet the threshold to be categorized as debt for cost-of-capital purposes but should be considered when valuing equity. In other words, we would subtract the values of these and other claims (such as potential costs from lawsuits against the firm) on equity from firm value to arrive at equity value. Employee options: Having arrived at the value of equity in the firm, we must make a final estimate, especially if the firm has made it a practice to grant options to managers. Because many of these options will still be outstanding, we have to consider them as another (and different) claim on equity. Although ","analysts often use shortcuts (such as adjusting the number of shares for dilution) to deal with these options, the right approach is to value the options (using an option pricing model), reduce the value of equity by the option value, and then divide by the actual number of shares outstanding. Table 2.10 summarizes the loose ends and how to deal with them in the different models. Table 2.10 Dealing with Loose Ends in Valuation Loose End Dividend Discount Model FCFE Model FCFF Model Cash and marketable securities Ignore, because net income includes interest income from cash. Ignore if FCFE is computed using total net income. Add if FCFE is computed using noncash net income. Add. Operating income does not include income from cash.

Employee options Uaually ignore Subtract value of equity options outstanding. Subtract value of equity options outstanding. ","A Valuation of 3M In the earlier sidebars, we estimated the inputs for 3M, ranging from existing cash flows (in the first sidebar) to cost of capital (in the fourth sidebar) to the terminal value computation (in the preceding sidebar). We first use the expected growth rate of 7.5% and the reinvestment rate of 30% that we estimated for the first five years to obtain the expected FCFF each year, as shown in Table 2.11. Table 2.11 Expected FCFF to 3M: The Next Five Years CurrentlyYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 After-tax operating income (growing at 7.5% a year) $3,586 $3,854 $4,144 $4,454 $4,788 $5,147 − Reinvestment (30% of income) $1,156 $1,243 $1,336 $1,437 $1,544 = FCFF $2,698 $2,900 $3,118 $3,352 $3,603 At the end of the fifth year, we assume that 3M becomes a stable-growth firm with a growth rate of 3% a year forever. Staying consistent with the parameters (44.4% reinvestment rate and 6.76% cost of capital) we estimated for 3M in stable growth in the preceding sidebar, we derive the FCFF in year 6 and the firm’s terminal value: Expected After-Tax Operating Income in Year 6 = $5,147 × 1.03 = $5,302 million Reinvestment Rate in Year 6 (44.4% of Income) = $2,355 million FCFF in Year 6 = $2,947 million Terminal Value at End of Year 5 = $2,947 / (.0676 − .03) = $78,464 million Using the cost of capital of 8.63% for the first 5 years, we discount back the cash flows for the next five years and the terminal value to arrive at an estimate of value for the operating assets of $60,719 million. Adding on the existing cash balance of $2,475 million and the value of existing minority cross-holdings in other firms of $778 million results in an overall value for ","3M of $67,289 million: Value of Operating Assets: $64,036 million + Cash and Marketable Securities: $2,475 million + Cross-Holdings in Other Companies: $778 million = Value of 3M as a Firm: $67,289 million Subtracting the debt outstanding in the firm yields the value of the equity in 3M: Finally, we estimate a value of $1,216 million for the equity options that have been granted over time to the managers at 3M and that are still outstanding: 9 Dividing by the actual number of shares outstanding results in a value per share of $86.95, slightly higher than the stock price prevailing in early September 2008 of $80 a share. Variations on DCF Valuation The discounted cash flow model described so far in this chapter is still the standard approach for estimating intrinsic value. However, variations on that approach also have the same objective. This section begins with a model in which we adjust the cash flows for risk, rather than the discount rate. Then we move on to the adjusted present-value model (where the effect of debt on value is separated from the operating assets) and excess-return models (where value is derived from earning excess returns on new investments). Certainty-Adjusted Cash Flow Models Whereas most analysts adjust the discount rate for risk in DCF valuation, some prefer to adjust the expected cash flows for risk. In the process, they replace the uncertain expected cash flows with the certainty equivalent cash flows, using a risk-adjustment process akin to the one used to adjust discount rates. ","Misunderstanding Risk Adjustment At the outset of this section, it should be emphasized that many analysts misunderstand what risk-adjusting the cash flows requires them to do. Some consider the cash flows of an asset under a variety of scenarios, ranging from best-case to catastrophic, assign probabilities to each one, take an expected value of the cash flows, and consider it risk-adjusted. While it is true that bad outcomes have been weighted to arrive at this cash flow, it is still an expected cash flow and is not risk-adjusted. To see why, assume that you are given a choice between two alternatives. In the first one, you are offered $95 with certainty. In the second, you will receive $100 with probability 90% and only $50 the rest of the time. The expected values of both alternatives are $95, but risk- averse investors would pick the first investment with guaranteed cash flows over the second one. Ways of Computing Certainty Equivalent Cash Flows The practical question that we will address in this section is how best to convert uncertain expected cash flows into guaranteed certainty equivalents. While we do not disagree with the notion that it should be a function of risk aversion, the estimation challenges remain daunting. Risk Adjustments Based on Utility Models The first (and oldest) approach to computing certainty equivalents is rooted in the utility functions for individuals. If we can specify the utility function of wealth for an individual, we are well set to convert risky cash flows to certainty equivalents for that individual. For instance, an individual with a log utility function would have demanded a certainty equivalent of $93.30 for the risky gamble presented in the last section (90% chance of $100 and 10% chance of $50): Utility from Gamble = .90 ln(100) + .10 ln(50) = 4.5359 Certainty Equivalent = exp 4.5359 = $93.30 The certainty equivalent of $93.30 delivers the same utility as the uncertain gamble with an expected value of $95. This process can be repeated for more complicated assets, and each expected cash flow can be converted into a certainty equivalent. One quirk of using utility models to estimate certainty equivalents is that the certainty equivalent of a positive expected cash flow can be negative. Consider, for instance, an investment where you can make $2,000 with probability 50% and lose $1,500 with probability 50%. The expected value of this investment is $250, but the certainty ","equivalent may very well be negative, with the effect depending on the utility function assumed. 10 Using this approach in practice has two problems. The first is that specifying a utility function for an individual or analyst is very difficult, if not impossible, to do with any degree of precision. In fact, most utility functions that are well behaved (mathematically) do not seem to explain actual behavior very well. The second problem is that, even if we could specify a utility function, this approach requires us to lay out all the scenarios that can unfold for an asset (with corresponding probabilities) for every time period. Not surprisingly, certainty equivalents from utility functions have been largely restricted to analyzing simple gambles in classrooms. Risk-and-Return Models A more practical approach to converting uncertain cash flows into certainty equivalents is offered by risk-and-return models. In fact, we would use the same approach to estimating risk premiums that we employ while computing risk-adjusted discount rates, but we would use the premiums to estimate certainty equivalents instead: Certainty Equivalent Cash Flow = Expected Cash Flow / (1 + Risk Premium in Risk- Adjusted Discount Rate) In the 3M valuation, for instance, note that the cost of capital of 8.63% is a risk- adjusted discount rate, based on its market risk exposure and current market conditions; the risk-free rate used was 3.72%. Instead of discounting the expected cash flow of $2,698 million in year 1 at 8.63%, we would decompose the discount rate into a risk- free rate of 3.72% and a compounded risk premium of 4.73%. 11 Using this risk premium, we can compute the certainty equivalent cash flow for 3M in year 1: Certainty Equivalent Cash Flow in Year1 = $2,698 million / 1.0473 = $2,576 million The present value of this certainty equivalent cash flow can then be computed at the risk-free rate: This process would be repeated for all the expected cash flows, with r the risk- adjustred discount rate and r f the risk free rate.: ","This adjustment has two effects. The first is that expected cash flows with higher uncertainty associated with them have lower certainty equivalents than more predictable cash flows at the same point in time. The second effect is that the effect of uncertainty compounds over time. This makes the certainty equivalents of uncertain cash flows further into the future lower than uncertain cash flows that will occur sooner. Cash Flow Haircuts A far more common approach to adjusting cash flows for uncertainty is to “haircut” the uncertain cash flows subjectively. With this approach, an analyst faced with uncertainty replaces uncertain cash flows with conservative or lowball estimates. This weapon is commonly employed by analysts who are forced to use the same discount rate for projects of different risk levels and who want to level the playing field. They haircut the cash flows of riskier projects to make them lower, thus hoping to compensate for the failure to adjust the discount rate for the additional risk. In a variation on this approach, some investors consider only cash flows on an asset that are predictable; they ignore risky or speculative cash flows when valuing the asset. Warren Buffet expresses his disdain for the CAPM and other risk-and-return models and claims to use the risk-free rate as the discount rate. We suspect that he can get away with doing so because of a combination of the types of companies he chooses to invest in and his inherent conservatism when it comes to estimating the cash flows. While cash flow haircuts retain their intuitive appeal, we should be wary of their usage. After all, gut feelings about risk can vary widely across analysts looking at the same asset; more risk-averse analysts will tend to haircut the cash flows on the same asset more than less risk-averse analysts. Furthermore, the distinction we drew between diversifiable and market risk when developing risk-and-return models can be lost when analysts make intuitive adjustments for risk. In other words, the cash flows may be adjusted downward for risk that will be eliminated in a portfolio. The absence of transparency about the risk adjustment can also lead to the double counting of risk, especially when the analysis passes through multiple layers of analysis. For example, after the first analyst looking at a risky investment decides to use conservative estimates of the cash flows, the analysis might pass to a second stage, where his superior might decide to make an additional risk adjustment to the already risk-adjusted cash flows. ","Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate or Certainty Equivalent Cash Flow Adjusting the discount rate for risk or replacing uncertain expected cash flows with certainty equivalents are alternative approaches to adjusting for risk, but do they yield different values? If so, which one is more precise? The answer lies in how we compute certainty equivalents. If we use the risk premiums from risk-and-return models to compute certainty equivalents, the values obtained from the two approaches will be the same. After all, adjusting the cash flow using the certainty equivalent and then discounting the cash flow at the risk-free rate is equivalent to discounting the cash flow at a risk-adjusted discount rate. To see this, consider an asset with a single cash flow in one year. Assume that r is the risk-adjusted cash flow, r f is the risk-free rate, and RP is the compounded risk premium, computed as described earlier in this section: This analysis can be extended to multiple time periods and will still hold. 12 Note, though, that if the approximation for the risk premium, computed as the difference between the risk-adjusted return and the risk-free rate, had been used, this equivalence will no longer hold. In that case, the certainty equivalent approach will give lower values for any risky asset, and the difference will increase with the size of the risk premium. Other scenarios exist in which the two approaches yield different values for the same risky asset. The first is when the risk-free rates and risk premiums change from time period to time period; the risk-adjusted discount rate also changes from period to period. Some argue that the certainty equivalent approach yields more precise estimates of value in this case. The other scenario is when the certainty equivalents are computed from utility functions or subjectively, whereas the risk-adjusted discount rate comes from a risk-and-return model. The two approaches can yield different estimates of value for a risky asset. Finally, the two approaches deal with negative cash flows differently. The risk-adjusted discount rate discounts negative cash flows at a higher rate, and the present value becomes less negative as the risk increases. If certainty equivalents are computed from utility functions, they can yield certainty equivalents that are negative and that become more negative as you increase risk—a finding that is more consistent with intuition. The biggest dangers arise when analysts use an amalgam of approaches, in which the cash flows are adjusted partially for risk, usually subjectively, and the discount rate is also adjusted for risk. It is easy to double-count risk in these cases, and the risk adjustment to value often becomes difficult to decipher. ","Adjusted Present-Value Models In the adjusted present value (APV) approach, we separate the effects on value of debt financing from the value of a business’s assets. In contrast to the conventional approach, where the effects of debt financing are captured in the discount rate, the APV approach attempts to estimate the expected dollar value of debt benefits and costs separately from the value of the operating assets. Basis of the APV Approach In the APV approach, we begin with the firm’s value without debt. As we add debt to the firm, we consider the net effect on value by considering both the benefits and costs of borrowing. In general, using debt to fund a firm’s operations creates tax benefits (because interest expenses are tax-deductible) on the plus side and increases bankruptcy risk (and expected bankruptcy costs) on the minus side. A firm’s value can be written as follows: Value of Business = Value of Business with 100% Equity Financing + Present Value of Expected Tax Benefits of Debt − Expected Bankruptcy Costs The first attempt to isolate the effect of tax benefits from borrowing was in Miller and Modigliani (1963). They valued the present value of the tax savings in debt as a perpetuity using the cost of debt as the discount rate. The adjusted present-value approach in its current form was first presented in Myers (1974) in the context of examining the interrelationship between investment and financing decisions. Implicitly, the adjusted present-value approach is built on the presumption that computing the valuation impact of debt in absolute terms rather than in proportional terms is easier and more precise. Firms, it is argued, do not state target debt as a ratio of market value (as implied by the cost-of-capital approach) but in dollar value terms. Measuring APV In the adjusted present value approach, we estimate the firm’s value in three steps. We begin by estimating the firm’s value with no leverage. We then consider the present value of the interest tax savings generated by borrowing a given amount of money. Finally, we evaluate the effect of borrowing the amount on the probability that the firm will go bankrupt, and the expected cost of bankruptcy. The first step in this approach is estimating the value of the unlevered firm. This can be accomplished by valuing the firm as if it has no debt—by discounting the expected free cash flow to the firm at the unlevered cost of equity. In the special case where cash flows grow at a constant rate in perpetuity, the firm’s value is easily computed: ","where FCFF 0 is the current after-tax operating cash flow to the firm, ρ u is the unlevered cost of equity, and g is the expected growth rate. In the more general case, we can value the firm using any set of growth assumptions we believe are reasonable for the firm. The inputs needed for this valuation are the expected cash flows, growth rates, and unlevered cost of equity. The second step in this approach is calculating the expected tax benefit from a given level of debt. This tax benefit is a function of the firm’s tax rate and is discounted to reflect the riskiness of this cash flow: We must address three estimation questions. The first is what tax rate to use in computing the tax benefit and whether that rate can change over time. The second is the dollar debt to use in computing the tax savings and whether that amount can vary across time. The final issue relates to what discount rate to use to compute the present value of the tax benefits. In the early iterations of APV, the tax rate and dollar debt were viewed as constants (resulting in tax savings as a perpetuity), and the pre-tax cost of debt was used as the discount rate leading to a simplification of the tax benefit value: Subsequent adaptations of the approach allowed for variations in both the tax rate and the dollar debt level and raised questions about whether it was appropriate to use the cost of debt as the discount rate. Fernandez (2004) argued that the value of tax benefits should be computed as the difference between the value of the levered firm with the interest tax savings and the value of the same firm without leverage. Consequently, he arrives at a much higher value for the tax savings than the conventional approach, by a multiple of the unlevered firm’s cost of equity to the cost of debt. Cooper and Nyborg (2006) argue that Fernandez is wrong and that the value of the tax shield is the present value of the interest tax savings, discounted back at the cost of debt. The third step is to evaluate the effect of the given level of debt on the firm’s default risk and on expected bankruptcy costs. In theory, at least, this requires estimating the probability of default with the additional debt and the direct and indirect cost of bankruptcy. If π a is the probability of default after the additional debt, and BC is the ","present value of the bankruptcy cost, the present value of expected bankruptcy cost can be estimated: This step of the adjusted present-value approach poses the most significant estimation problem, because neither the probability of bankruptcy nor the bankruptcy cost can be estimated directly. The probability of bankruptcy can be estimated indirectly in two basic ways. One is to estimate a bond rating, as we did in the cost-of-capital approach, at each level of debt and use the empirical estimates of default probabilities for each rating. The other is to use a statistical approach to estimate the probability of default, based on the firm’s observable characteristics, at each level of debt. The bankruptcy cost can be estimated, albeit with considerable error, from studies that have looked at the magnitude of this cost in actual bankruptcies. Research that has looked at the direct cost of bankruptcy concludes that it is small relative to firm value. 13 In fact, the costs of distress stretch far beyond the conventional costs of bankruptcy and liquidation. The perception of distress can do serious damage to a firm’s operations as employees, customers, suppliers, and lenders react. Firms that are viewed as distressed lose customers (and sales), have higher employee turnover, and have to accept much tighter restrictions from suppliers than healthy firms. These indirect bankruptcy costs can be catastrophic for many firms and essentially make the perception of distress into a reality. The magnitude of these costs has been examined in studies and can range from 10% to 25% of firm value. 14 Cost of Capital Versus APV Valuation In an APV valuation, the value of a levered firm is obtained by adding the net effect of debt to the unlevered firm value: ρ π The tax savings from debt are discounted back at the cost of debt. In the cost-of-capital approach, the effects of leverage show up in the cost of capital. The tax benefit is incorporated into the after-tax cost of debt and the bankruptcy costs in both the levered beta and the pre-tax cost of debt. Inselbag and Kaufold (1997) provide examples where they get identical values using the APV and cost-of-capital approaches, but only because they infer the costs of equity to use in the latter. Will these approaches yield the same value? Not necessarily. The first reason for the differences is that the models consider bankruptcy costs very differently. The adjusted present-value approach provides more flexibility in allowing you to consider indirect ","bankruptcy costs. To the extent that these costs do not show up or show up inadequately in the pre-tax cost of debt, the APV approach yields a more conservative estimate of value. The second reason is that the conventional APV approach considers the tax benefit from a fixed-dollar debt value, usually based on existing debt. The cost-of- capital and compressed APV approaches estimate the tax benefit from a debt ratio that might require the firm to borrow increasing amounts in the future. For instance, assuming a market debt-to-capital ratio of 30% in perpetuity for a growing firm will require it to borrow more in the future, and the tax benefit from expected future borrowings is incorporated into value today. Finally, the discount rate used to compute the present value of tax benefits is the pre-tax cost of debt in the conventional APV approach. It is the unlevered cost of equity in the cost-of-capital approach. The conventional APV approach yields a higher value than the cost of capital approach because it views the tax savings from debt as less risky and assigns a higher value to these savings. Which approach yields more reasonable estimates of value? The dollar debt assumption in the APV approach is a more conservative one, but the fundamental flaw with the APV model lies in the difficulties associated with estimating expected bankruptcy costs. As long as that cost cannot be estimated, the APV approach will continue to be used in half-baked form. The present value of tax benefits will be added to the unlevered firm value to arrive at total firm value and yield the unsurprising conclusion that borrowing more always increases value. Excess-Return Models The model that we have presented in this section, where expected cash flows are discounted back at a risk-adjusted discount rate, is the most commonly used discounted cash flow approach, but variations exist. In the excess-return valuation approach, we separate the cash flows into excess-return cash flows and normal return cash flows. Earning the risk-adjusted required return (cost of capital or equity) is considered a normal return cash flow, but any cash flows above or below this number are categorized as excess returns. Therefore, excess returns can be either positive or negative. With the excess-return valuation framework, the value of a business can be written as the sum of two components: Value of Business = Capital Invested in Firm Today + Present Value of Excess-Return Cash Flows from Both Existing and Future Projects Suppose we assume that the accounting measure of capital invested (book value of capital) is a good measure of capital invested in assets today. This approach implies that firms that earn positive excess-return cash flows will trade at market values higher ","than their book values. It also implies that the firms that earn negative excess-return cash flows will trade at below book value. Basis of the Models Excess-return models have their roots in capital budgeting and the net present-value rule. In effect, an investment adds value to a business only if it has positive net present value, no matter how profitable it might seem on the surface. This also implies that earnings and cash flow growth have value only when they are accompanied by excess returns—returns on equity (capital) that exceed the cost of equity (capital). Excess- return models take this conclusion to the logical next step and compute a firm’s value as a function of expected excess returns. Although numerous versions of excess-return models exist, this section considers one widely used variant—economic value added (EVA). EVA measures the surplus value created by an investment or a portfolio of investments. It is computed as the product of the “excess return” made on an investment or investments and the capital invested in that investment or investments: EVA is a simple extension of the net present-value rule. The project’s net present value (NPV) is the present value of the economic value added by that project over its life: 15 where EVA t is the economic value added by the project in year t, the project has a life of n years, and k c is the cost of capital. This connection between EVA and NPV allows us to link a firm’s value to the economic value added by that firm. To see this, let us begin with a simple formulation of firm value in terms of the value of assets in place and expected future growth: Firm Value = Value of Assets in Place + Value of Expected Future Growth Note that in a discounted cash flow model, the values of both assets in place and expected future growth can be written in terms of the net present value created by each component: ","Substituting the economic value added version of net present value into this equation, we get the following: Thus, a firm’s value can be written as the sum of three components: The capital invested in assets in place The present value of the economic value added by these assets The expected present value of the economic value that will be added by future investments Note that the reasoning used for firm value can be applied just as easily to equity value, leading to the following equation, stated in terms of equity excess returns: Equity EVA = (Return on Equity − Cost of Equity) × Equity Invested Assets in Place Note that k e is the cost of equity. Measuring EVA The definition of EVA outlines three basic inputs we need for its computation—the return on capital earned on investments, the cost of capital for those investments, and the capital invested in them. We talked about the first inputs in the context of conventional DCF models. Everything we said in that context applies to measuring EVA as well. The last input—capital invested in existing assets—is a key input to excess-return models, because it represents the base on which the excess returns are computed. One obvious measure is the firm’s market value, but market value includes capital invested not just in assets in place but in expected future growth. 16 Because we want to evaluate the quality of assets in place, we need a measure of the capital invested in these assets. Given the difficulty of estimating the value of assets in place, it is not surprising that we turn to the book value of capital as a proxy for the capital invested in assets in place. The book value, however, is a number that reflects not just the accounting choices made ","in the current period, but also accounting decisions made over time on how to depreciate assets, value inventory, and deal with acquisitions. The older the firm, the more extensive the adjustments that have to be made to book value of capital to get to a reasonable estimate of the market value of capital invested in assets in place. Because this requires that we know and take into account every accounting decision over time, sometimes the book value of capital is too flawed to be fixable. Here, it is best to estimate the capital invested from the ground up, starting with the assets owned by the firm, estimating the market value of these assets, and cumulating this market value. Equivalence of Excess Return and DCF Valuation Models It is relatively simple to show that a firm’s discounted cash flow value should match the value you obtain from an excess-return model if you are consistent in your assumptions about growth and reinvestment. In particular, excess-return models are built around a link between reinvestment and growth. In other words, a firm can generate higher earnings in the future only by reinvesting in new assets or using existing assets more efficiently. Discounted cash flow models often do not make this linkage explicit, even though you can argue that they should. Thus, analysts often estimate growth rates and reinvestment as separate inputs and don’t make explicit links between the two. The model values can diverge because of differences in assumptions and ease of estimation. Penman and Sourgiannis (1998) compared the dividend discount model to excess-return models. They concluded that the valuation errors in a discounted cash flow model with a ten-year horizon significantly exceeded the errors in an excess- return model. They attributed the difference to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) accrual earnings being more informative than either cash flows or dividends. Francis, Olson, and Oswald (1999) concurred with Penman and also found that excess- return models outperform dividend discount models. Courteau, Kao, and Richardson (2001) argued that the superiority of excess-return models in these studies can be attributed entirely to differences in the terminal value calculation. They also said that using a terminal price estimated by Value Line (instead of estimating one) results in dividend discount models outperforming excess-return models. What Do Intrinsic Valuation Models Tell Us? All the approaches described in this chapter try to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset or business. However, understanding exactly what we are doing in the process is important. We are estimating what an asset or business is worth, given its cash flows and the risk in those cash flows. To the extent that the value is dependent on the assumptions we make about cash flows, growth, and risk, it represents what we think the intrinsic value is at any point in time. ","So, what if the intrinsic value we derive is very different from the market price? Several explanations are possible. One is that we have made erroneous or unrealistic assumptions about a company’s future growth potential or riskiness. A second and related explanation is that we have made incorrect assessments of risk premiums for the entire market. A third is that the market is, in fact, making a mistake in its assessment of value. Even in the last scenario, where our assessment of value is right and the market price is wrong, we have no guarantee that we can make money on our valuations. For that to occur, markets have to correct their mistakes, and that might not happen in the near future. In fact, we can buy stocks that we believe are undervalued and find that they become more undervalued over time. That is why a long time horizon is almost a prerequisite for using intrinsic valuation models. Giving the market more time (say, three to five years) to fix its mistakes provides better odds than hoping it will happen in the next quarter or the next six months. Conclusion A company’s intrinsic value reflects its fundamentals. The primary tool for estimating intrinsic value is the discounted cash flow model. We started by looking at the contrast between valuing the equity in a business and valuing the entire business, and then we moved on to the four inputs we need for the model. The cash flows to equity investors can be defined strictly as dividends, more expansively as dividends augmented with stock buybacks, and most generally as free cash flows to equity (potential dividends). The cash flow to the firm is the cumulative cash flow to both equity investors and lenders and thus is a predebt cash flow. The discount rates we apply have to be consistent with the cash flow definition, with the cost of equity used to discount cash flows to equity and the cost of capital to discount cash flows to the firm. When estimating growth, we noted the limitations of historical growth numbers and outside estimates and the importance of linking growth to fundamentals. Finally, we applied closure to the models by assuming that cash flows will settle into stable growth sometime in the future, but we imposed constraints on what this growth rate can be and the characteristics of stable-growth companies. We closed the chapter by looking at three variations on the discounted cash flow model. In the certainty equivalent approach, we adjusted the cash flows for risk and discounted back at the risk-free rate. In the adjusted present-value approach, we separated debt from the firm’s operating assets and valued its effects independently of the firm. In the excess-return model, we zeroed in on the fact that it is not growth per se that creates value but growth with excess returns. However, we noted that the models agree at the core, although there are minor differences in assumptions. ___________________________ ","1.

Note that we do not make the distinction between operating and nonoperating cash that some analysts do (they proceed to include operating cash in working capital). Our distinction is between wasting cash (which would include currency or cash earning below-market rate returns) and nonwasting cash. We are assuming that the former will be a small or negligible number at a publicly traded company. 4. In effect, when computing taxes on operating income, we act like we have no interest expenses or tax benefits from those expenses while computing the cash flow. This is because we will be counting the tax benefits from debt in the cost of capital (through the use of an after-tax cost of debt). If we use actual taxes paid or reflect the tax benefits from interest expenses in the cash flows, we are double-counting its effect. 5. In practical terms, this firm will have to raise external financing, either from debt or equity, or both, to cover the excess reinvestment. 6. The simplest and most widely used equation relating betas to debt-to-equity ratios is based on the assumption that debt provides a tax advantage and that the beta of debt is 0: Beta for Equity = Beta of Business × (1 + (1 − Tax Rate) (Debt / Equity)) The beta for equity is a levered beta, whereas the beta of the business is called an unlevered beta. Regression betas are equity betas and thus are levered. The debt-to-equity ratio over the regression period is embedded in the beta. 7. To get a sense of the problems with using accounting numbers, and how best to correct for them, see Damodaran, A., 2007, “Return on Capital, Return on Invested Capital and Return on Equity: Measurement and Implications,” working paper, SSRN. 8. You do not have to assume a perpetuity, if you feel uncomfortable with a “forever” assumption. You can use a growing annuity, where your cash flows grow at x% a year for the next 20 or 25 years and compute your terminal value on that basis. 9. 58.82 million options were outstanding at the end of 2007, with a weighted average strike price of $66.83 and 5.5 years left to expiration. We valued these options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. 10. The certainty equivalent will be negative in this example for some utility functions for wealth. Intuitively, this would indicate that an investor with this utility function would actually pay to avoid being exposed to this gamble (even though it has a positive expected value). 11. A more common approximation used by many analysts is the difference between the risk-adjusted discount rate and the risk-free rate. In this case, that would have yielded a risk premium of 4.91% (8.63% − 3.72% = 4.91%). 12. The proposition that risk-adjusted discount rates and certainty equivalents yield identical net present values is shown in Stapleton, R. C., 1971. 13. Warner, J. N., 1977, studied railroad bankruptcies and concluded that the direct cost of bankruptcy was only 5% on the day before bankruptcy. And it is even lower when assessed five years before the bankruptcy. 14. For an examination of the theory behind indirect bankruptcy costs, see Opler, T. and S. Titman, 1994. For an estimate of how large these indirect bankruptcy costs are in the real world, see Andrade, G. and S. Kaplan, 1998. They looked at highly levered transactions that subsequently became distressed and concluded that the magnitude of these costs ranges from 10% to 23% of firm value. 15. This is true, though, only if the expected present value of the cash flows from depreciation is assumed to be equal to the present value of the return of the capital invested in the project. A proof of this equality can be found in Damodaran, A, 1999. 16. As an illustration, computing the return on capital at Microsoft or Google using the firm’s market value, instead of book value, results in a return on capital of about 13%. It would be a mistake to view this as a sign of poor investments on the part of the firm’s managers. "]
